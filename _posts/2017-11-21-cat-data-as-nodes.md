Recently, I've been messing around with different ways to display categorical data. I do a fair bit of work with categorical data, and in my presentations and reports I was getting a bit sick of bar charts and tables (and pie charts [are out](https://excelcharts.com/pie-charts-a-neverending-discussion)). 

A nice solution is the use of d3 nodes to map categorical data, [like so](https://bl.ocks.org/bsuthersan/5a655c4922c7490ba1b933200b0d1b71). Here, each node represents a different user, and by clicking the user buttons at the top you can group them by 'Group', or 'Gender'. (Note that all the data is simulated). 

This graphic takes a little bit of coding and customisation, so probably not something you could incorporate into every presentation, but it's still a nice way of visualising and grouping categorical data. If nothing else it's a bit more interesting than a bar chart!
