It wasn't until after I went through the process of using Leaflet.js itself that I discovered that there is a [Leaflet package for R!](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/). The documentation promised that "this R package makes it easy to integrate and control Leaflet maps in R", and they weren't wrong.

To test it out, I got a hold of some [data on life satisfaction by borough](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/subjective-personal-well-being-borough), sourced from the Annual Population Survey (APS) Well-being dataset.
