The Leaflet package itself is really easy to use and deploy, and can be built layer-by-layer. First, we set the map view by calling the coordinates that we want the map to centre on, as well as the zoom (in this case, 12.4)

```javascript
    var map = L.map('mapid2').
    setView([51.5131224, -0.21997120000003179], 12.4);
```
Then we add functions for setting the colour for the legend:

```javascript
function getColor(d) {
    return d > 80  ? '#99CC00' :
           d > 60 ? 'steelblue' :
           d > 40   ? 'purple' :
           d > 20   ? 'grey' :
           d > 0   ? 'black' :
                      '#99CC00';
           
}
```
As well as functions to style each of the areas:

```javascript
function style(feature) {
return {
        fillColor: getColor(feature.properties.Decile),
        weight: 1,
        opacity: 1,
        color: 'grey',
        dashArray: '3',
        fillOpacity: 0.7
    };
```

And a function to style each of these areas, on mouse hover:

function highlightFeature(e) {
		var layer = e.target;

```javascript
		layer.setStyle({
			weight: 5,
			color: '#666',
			dashArray: '',
			fillOpacity: 0.7
		});
  ```
