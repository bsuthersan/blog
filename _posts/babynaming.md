title: How to use R and shiny to name your child
---
# Step 1

Get pregnant. There are many excellent guides and hacks out there to help you with this part of the process. 

# Step 2

Argue with partner for several weeks about baby names. Go backwards and forwards on several names. Contemplate divorce.

# Step 3

Using Hadley Wickham's awesome `babynames` package, pull in historical data on babynames in the United States into R. Also read in a csv with name meanings you obtained from: https://www.babynames.com/Names/search.php

Perform minimal pre-processing of both datasets and merge together.

# Step 4

Create a shiny App to visualise the popularity of baby names over time, as well as name meanings, and host it here: https://bsuthersan.shinyapps.io/babynames-master/

# Step 5

Quietly despair for your unborn child and their gene pool. 

Fin.
