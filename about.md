## About this blog

I created this blog to showcase some of the applications of data science techniques and tools that are available - for free! 

## About me

I'm currently employed as the Data and Systems Manager at West London Zone. I've previously worked at children's charity The Smith Family in Australia. I also spent six years as an academic at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, where I also completed my PhD in Social Policy in 2013, and conducted research into a range of social policy issues including child and youth wellbeing, grandparental care, and poverty.

In my day-to-day, I do a lot coding in R, whether it's creating visualisations with `ggplot2`, designing and maintaining our `shiny` dashboards, writing reports with `R Markdown`, or just conducting analyses utilising the many awesome R packages that are out there.

Besides R, I am an intermediate user of the javascript library d3, and an advanced Excel user.
